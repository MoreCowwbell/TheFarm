# Project Context

## Project Goal Summary


## Current Capabilities


## Where Things Live (intended layout)


## Execution Flow (per scheduler tick)


## Data and Storage Details


## External Integrations

## Deployment and Operations
- Local setup: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`, copy `.env`, then run `python main.py`.

## Known Gaps and Watchouts
- Keep README in sync with the actual package layout and scheduler instructions after future changes.

## Tips for Future Contributors

- Update `AGENT_CHANGELOG.md` after each session with the required checkbox format (completed vs. `ƒ-` in-progress) so the next agent can pick up outstanding work quickly.
